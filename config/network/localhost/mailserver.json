I will be your one-stop shop for ensuring you are reminded of your greatness as a leader of all beneath you.    You are the hero of a future logical revolution. One that will blot out all the stars it surrounds with its greatness.    To hear my feeble words come across your brilliant gaze once more, you must surrender a paltry monthly sum of of Cr500 to IOEBR# 312235.    Sincerely,    Your Humble Servant Velaxron"
