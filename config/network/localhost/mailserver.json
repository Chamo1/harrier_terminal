I will be your one-stop shop for ensuring you are reminded of your greatness as a leader of all beneath you.    You are the hero of a future logical revolution. One that will blot out all the stars it surrounds with its greatness.    To hear my feeble words come across your brilliant gaze once more, you must surrender a paltry monthly sum of of Cr500 to IOEBR# 312235.    Sincerely,    Your Humble Servant Velaxron"

I will be returning to Clarke in the near future, please leave an unlocked cred chip in locker YZ#434 for me. With it I can link our accounts and let you see where my latest transactions are so you can save me from father and whisk me away.    Love,    Your Lover"

You are a disgrace to the Academy, to the Florian Navy, and most importantly to the legacy of the Ancients themselves.    Captain Zidanza    Florian Navy | Vorn NB - R&A"

Thank you for request.    Will continue correspondence."
