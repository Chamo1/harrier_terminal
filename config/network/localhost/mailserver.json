Portion on sophont ape was most enjoyable. Thank you for recommendation.    May the dull death be destroyed and the League ascend.    Will continue correspondence."

Cauliflower ear, also known as perichondrial hematoma or wrestler’s ear, is a deformity of the ear caused by trauma.    Cauliflower ear occurs when blood pools in your pinna after it’s been hit or struck. The pinna is your outer ear. This pooling of blood, known as a hematoma, needs to be treated right away.    While there’s no treatment for cauliflower ear, it can be prevented even after the trauma has occurred.

Eaiyho, an Aslan born near the Imperial Core weighing in at 300 pounds hoping to make his way up the Imperial Boxing Circuit within the Trojan Reach, and Theatw, a human weighing in at 303 pounds hailing from the world of Boulder, met in the ring and fought a seven round match. In the seventh round Theatw looked as if the towel would have to be surrendered to the might lion, but in a shocking rallied state he delivered four critical hits to the Aslan's abdomen taking him down for the count.    Sadly the strikes proved fatal and Eaiyho passed away four hours after the match at a local medical center due to organ failure.    The Trojan Rech Boxing Commission is currently investigating if any foul play or cheating was involved before the win can be officially declared for Theatw."
